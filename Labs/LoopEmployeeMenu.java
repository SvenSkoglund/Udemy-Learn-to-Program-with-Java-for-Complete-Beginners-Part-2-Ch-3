/*Starting here we introduce a program that you build a piece at a time, adding capabilities to the
program after each chapter as you learn more techniques of computer programming. You may not
have time to work on the project this week, in which case you can use it as a post-class project to
practice what you've learned after this class is over.

Write a program that displays a menu on the screen:

Read the option number, then display a message:

Put your employee program into an infinite loop. Make sure the exit option works so the user can
end the program.*/
